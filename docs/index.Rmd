## Covid Report

Using the New York Times Covid-19 data found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us.csv). I analyzed and will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`.

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
